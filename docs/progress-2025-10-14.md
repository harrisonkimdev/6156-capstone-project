# Progress Summary – 2025-10-14

## Data Ingestion & Utilities
- Modularised frame extraction (`pose_ai.data.frame_sampler`) and route detection helpers (`pose_ai.data.route_detection`) from the BetaMove notebook.
- Added manifest tooling (`pose_ai.data.metrics`) to convert extracted frame metadata into segmentation-ready metrics.
- Created CLI scripts:
  - `scripts/extract_frames.py` for batch frame extraction.
  - `scripts/run_segmentation.py` for rule-based rest/movement segmentation.
  - `scripts/run_pose_estimation.py` for pose inference over manifests.

## Segmentation Pipeline
- Implemented rule-based segmentation module (`pose_ai.segmentation.rule_based`) with supporting data classes.
- Added service layer orchestration (`pose_ai.service.segmentation_service`) to bridge manifests, metrics, and segmentation.

## Pose Estimation
- Built pose estimation scaffold (`pose_ai.pose.estimator`, `pose_ai.pose.filters`) supporting MediaPipe integration and landmark smoothing.
- Added pose service (`pose_ai.service.pose_service`) to persist pose results alongside frames.

## Testing
- Added unit tests covering:
  - Frame extraction and manifest parsing.
  - Route detection utilities.
  - Segmentation heuristics and services.
  - Pose estimator smoothing and pose service orchestration.

## Documentation
- Updated `docs/design.md` to reflect new modules, scripts, and validation coverage.
